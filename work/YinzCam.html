                            My design focused on a younger generation —— <b>the morden football fans</b> aging under 30. Most morden football fans are priced out of the live games. However, the proliferation of videos, news and social platforms provides them with more unfettered accesses to football than any generations before. The paradoxical environment the morden football fans are  facing with makes them the most promising user group of YinzCam.

                        <p>Participatory-focused fans enjoy the feeling of experiencing something together. For them, the mere psychological act of connecting and belonging is an extremely strong motivation. One unique behavior of them is <b>"two-screening" the game</b> , which means using one device to watch the game while using another one to chat on social media. The biggest pinpoint for them is that switching from different devices interrupts their experiences while watching the game.

                        <p>Spectator-focused fans not only watch the lives but also enjoy reading related news, interviews, reports and comments. They are proud of being a "know-it-all" of the team and <b>highly focus on stats</b>. Before the game, they like to make their predictions of the scores based on stats they got. After the game, they enjoy searching for stats from authoritative media and make their analysis. But the football stats they need are sometimes hard to find and read.

                        <p>The occasional visitors are not actually fans so I considered them as the secondary users. They are occasional fans that are trying to relate to someone in their life, such as a girl dating with a fan man, a son born in a fan family, or a person surrounded by fan friends. Since occasional fans don't "live and die" with their team, they may have no time or motivation to watch the whole game so they <b>only focus on the highlight part</b>.

                            <b>The Participatory-Focused Fan</b> Penny likes to "two-screen" the game but gets annoyed by switching from devices. <b>The Spectator-Focused Fan</b> Anderson enjoys football stats but finding and reading them is always time-consuming. <b>The Occasional Visitor</b> Rachel is not a big fan of the team. All she wants is to quickly know the highlights that she can talk about with her fan friends. 
                            <br>
                            Therefore, here are three "How Might We" questions I kept in mind when brainstorming.

                            <li>How might we make the game stats clear and easy to read for Anderson?</li>
                            <li>How might we help Rachel to reach the highlights quickly?</li>

                            <b>The Participatory-Focused Fans</b> like Penny have the strong sense of involvement and require communication eagerly while watching the game. As Mark Cuban said: "We don't sell the game. We sell a chance to create shared experiences."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then how might we support this type of fans with non-disruptive experiences that they could communicate while watching the game in the mean time? 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My design idea is to embed <b>Bullet Comments</b> (comments that will fly across the screen )  into the video, allowing fans to "chat" with friends and other likeminded fans while watching the game. Fans are able to write their opinions, complains, questions or even arguments going on with the game, and share them with everyone who are watching together.

                        <p>
                            1) Use timeline to show the highlights of the game in chronological order.

                        <p>
                            2) Provide users with related statistics, video and news report that are aligned with text description, making it easier to understand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            3) If the game is finished, users will see a page that centralizes game stats and highlights. If the game hasn't started yet, users will see a page where they are allowed to make prediction and share with friends.

                           This feature was originally designed only for Rachel who has no time or motivation to watch the whole video, surprisingly, it was proved to be greatly welcomed by all three type of fans. For Rachel, this design can help her go directly to the highlights. For Penny and Anderson, they can go over the highlights and enjoy the amazing moments again and again.

                            However, the video node and thumbnail design may cause confusion to users. The ideal actions are: 1) users hover on one node and see the video thumbnail; 2) users click one node and go to that video clips. However, users don' t have the "hover" action when using an app. In that case, if user click one node, they are not sure whether they will go to the clips or they will just see the thumbnails. My solution is to redesign the user actions here:
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            1) Normally, users can both drag progressive bar or click on it to enter a video clip. However, in this design, users can only drag the progressive bar to enter a video clip.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            2) If user click one node on the progressive bar, they will only see the thumbnails.
                        </p>
                         <p>
                            3) If user drag the progressive bar to that node, or click the thumbnail, they will see the related video clip showing the highlight part.
