                        <p>
                            My design focused on a younger generation - the <b>morden football fans</b> aging under 30. Most morden football fans are priced out of the live matches. However, the proliferation of videos, news and social platforms provides them with a more unfettered access to the matches than any generation before. The paradoxical environment they're facing with makes them the most promising user group of our mobile app.

                        <h1>WHAT DO THEY LOOK LIKE</h1>
                        <h2> Say hello to Slack </h2>
                        <p>Now you're clear about who is the target user, let's start designing! But wait…before moving on to the next step, I hope to get a better understanding about a modern football fan including:</p>
                        <p>What does a modern football fan look like when they're watching the games? What do they like or dislike about?</p>
                        <p>What are their goals, motivations, behaviors and values when they're watching the games? </p>
                        <p>What are their pinpoints? What are the problems they're facing</p>
                        <p>To do this, I conducted user survey with 15 morden football fans (age 16–30) and contextual interviews with 10 morden football fans (age 16–29). I asked them to think aloud while watching the games to capture the demographic and attitudinal factors that will shape the design ideas of a modern fan app.</p>

                        <h1>The Participatory-Focused Fan</h1>
                        <p>Participatory-focused fans enjoy the feeling of experiencing something together. For them, the mere psychological act of connecting and belonging is an extremely strong motivation. One unique behavior of them is <b>"two-screening" the match</b> , which means using one device to watch the game while using another one to chat on social media. Therefore, the biggest pinpoint for them is switching from different devices interrupts their experience when watching the game.

                        <h1>The Spectator-Focused Fan</h1>
                        <p>Spectator-focused fans not only watch the lives but also enjoy reading related news, interviews, reports and comments. They are proud of being a "know-it-all" of the team and highly focus on <b>stats</b>. Before the game, they like to make their predictions of the scores based on stats they got. After the game, they enjoy searching for stats and reviews from authoritative media. Their biggest pinpoint is, the football stats they need are sometimes hard to find and read.

                        <h1>The Occasional Visitor</h1>
                        <p>The occasional visitors are not actually fans so I considered them as the secondary users. They are occasional fans that are trying to relate to someone in their life, such as a girl dating with a fan man, a daughter in a fan family, or a person surrounded by a banch of fan friends. Since occasional fans don't "live and die" with their team, they watch football <b>only when they can find time</b>. Their problem is, they may have no time or motivation to watch the whole game so they focus more on the highlight part.
