                    Portfolio-making, in its simplest form, entails documentation, curation, and presentation. According to literature review, <b>portfolio making is not linear but naturally iterative</b>. Continuous iterations occur at curation stage, where learning arise simultaneously.

                    IDeATe is made up of undergraduate and graduate students in CMU. To better understand portfolio-making process of college students, we initially interviewed four students with varied experiences in portfolio making and conducted think aloud with them while going through their websites. We synthesized data using affinity diagram to find out general requirements of portfolio makers.

                    This synthesis model below represents what they are (conceptual requirements), what they need (dispositional requirements) and what they want (motivational requirements) in a portfolio making process. One interesting finding is, <b>interactions with others are essential in portfolio making process</b>. From literature review, we’ve already know that portfolio making is naturally iterative. During this messy process, <b>external evaluation, guidance and feedback are highly required by portfolio makers</b> to help them make changes, learn new skills and get improvement.

We invited them to tell their portfolio making experiences with IDeATe Gallery, including their background and skill sets, motivations and challenges, likes and dislikes. All interviewees were mapped into two groups. The purple group represents novice who had project experience less than 2 years and the green group represents expert who had 2 years project experience or more. From the interview, <b>both novice and expert are engaged in feedback but from different perspectives</b>. Most novices are feedback-seekers while most expert are willing to give feedback.

                    <br>
                    We met with Kelly Deleany (Assistant Director of the IDeATe program) and Daragh Byrne (Creator of IDeAte Gallery) to talk about how IDeATe Gallery was intended to help students making portfolios. We wanted to know:  1) Establishment idea of IDeATe Gallery. 2) Design decisions they made under this idea. 3) What problems they are facing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kelly explained IDeAte Gallery was created as an interdisciplinary community where different departments from the university converge to learn from one another through communication and Daragh hoped Gallery to be a space where students could practice, improve, and eventually transfer what they learned to make highly-curated professional portfolios. Daragh mentioned that the two drivers of Gallery were documentation function and comment function, but currently the comment function was not active. He was worried students learned little from IDeATe Gallery because most students used Gallery as a showcasing tool. They just published their work on it without communications or interactions with others.

                    To learn the inner workings and the internal culture of IDeATe, we conducted a site studies which combined direct observations and interviews together. We want to observe: 1) How IDeATe students learn and work in the site. 2) How IDeATe students interact with other students, TAs and faculties. 3) How they document their in-progress works while making (which is evidence for portfolio). At the same time, we want to interview: 1) How IDeATe students use IDeATe Gallery. 2) How IDeATe students think of IDeATe.

                    We found out that most IDeATe students <b>didn’t use IDeATe Gallery to document and curate their in-progress works</b>. They prefers other platforms including personal websites, class blogs and other portfolio making websites to do the documentation and curation stuff, where they could share their draft projects with friends or have class critiques to get feedback. As for IDeATe Gallery, most students used it only to showcase polished projects. One students mentioned that: ”Gallery only presents the final projects.”

                    According to the insights, feedback is the key to solving IDeATe Gallery’s problem. <b>IDeATe Gallery was initially created as a learning tool but eventually used as a showcasing tool mainly because it fails to provide a learning environment where students are engaged into feedback giving and receiving. </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, we decided to design a <b>feedback loop</b> to help building collaborative and supportive learning environment in IDeATe Gallery. We believed that by building in better opportunity for feedback, both novice and expert students will be able to optimize their overall learning experiences through sharing their expertise and contributing to the community.

                <br>
                    We adopted a design probe to try out our feedback idea and understand the subtle qualities of experience. We designed two posters - one for expert to give feedback and one for novice to ask for feedback - and hung up them in the IDeAte space to probe students’ interactions. We prepared a packages containing sticky notes, emoji and conversational bubbles next to the posters, and waited for a week to see how students would leave or ask for feedback on the poster.

                   We built paper prototype to observe users’ interactions when going through the feedback loop. This time, we were able to see real questions students would ask. By giving users some voice, we let them draw sketches they can relate to and ask questions that truly matter to them.

                    Our second-round research shows that IDeATe students were engaged in feedback loop we designed but several questions remained in their feedback giving & receiving experience. <b>First, novices feel struggling to identify their projects to specific fields.</b> For instance, Kelly is making a cat house through laser-cutting for her architecture class. She’s not sure the feedback she expect should be about the cat, the laser-cutting or the architecture, which also causes difficulty for her to decide who to ask. <b>Second, it is hard for novices to clearly identify their problems they’re facing, and to make targeted problem description.</b> During our paper prototyping, few interviewees could “type” (which is writing) their questions directly while most of them subconsciously pointed to where they thought was problematic and spoke. <b>Third, though novices want feedback, they have no ideas about who to ask and where to find them.</b> For most IDeATe students, instructors were their first (and maybe only) choice when they were seeking for feedback. <b>Forth, experts are willing to give feedback but sometimes they are short of motivation to do so.</b> Expert desired to see how their feedback would help and how their effort would contribute rather than receiving a “thank you” note. We collected all their struggling and generated four “How might we”.
