                    Collecting both primary and secondary emotions can help people to clearly identity their mood. Collecting <span class="clickable"><span class="tooltip" title="Imagine something has happened, and suddenly you're feeling an emotion. It's strong; it's the first reaction to what has happened. That is a primary emotion. Primary emotions are the body's first response, and they're usually very easy to identify because they're so strong. The most common primary emotions are Joyful, Powerful, Peaceful, Mad, Sad, Scared.">primary emotion</span></span> can help finding the real cause behind a person’s mood, while collecting <span class="clickable"><span class="tooltip" title="Secondary emotions are not as innate as primary emotions, and they do not have a corresponding facial expression that makes them universally recognizable. Secondary emotions are much more complex because they often refer to the feelings you have about the primary emotion. For example, when you feel angry you may feel ashamed afterward, when you feel the joy, you may feel hopeful, creative or cheerful. In Star Wars, Master Yoda explained secondary emotions perfectly - Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate, hate leads to suffering.">secondary emotion</span></span> will help them learn about how the mood subtly changes, which is usually unconscious. Looking at both primary and secondary emotions can give a fuller picture of users’ mood patterns, which can greatly help with emotional awareness.

                <p>
                    Non-verbal cues occupy about 60-65% of human communication (Birdwhistell, 1970), which can help enhancing clarity for the messages being sent and building empathy during communication. In order to help users distinguish difference moods, the conversational bubbles we designed are coded to different colors and shapes.

                <p>
                    The sense of being heard is highly valued by users. Instead of recording mood in a usual way, we designed an agent who can guide users to record their mood in a conversational context, just like chatting with a friend.

                    We used a storyboard to test our design idea with 12 users and got positive feedback in general: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            User thought recognizing moods by primary and secondary levels did help them clarify their feelings, as long as they were properly guided.

                        <li>
                            User enjoyed the feeling of conversation.

                        <li>

                        <li>
                           Users were encouraged to input their activities by themselves. However, without enough guidence, they felt stuck in what to input and how to input（"Does the input format matter?"). Therefore, we added some preset options for them as a reference. Users can identify their activities by selceting existing ones or adding a new one.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            We prompted users to document both emotional state and activities they were doing. However, current activities may not be the necessary triggers. Therefore, we added an optional notes for users to specify reasons of emotions later.

                <p>
                    Anonymity reinforces mood sharing. Research shows that anonymity is related to the amount of self-disclosure (McKenna & Bargh, 1999, 2000; McKenna, Green, & Gleason, 2002), which means people tend to sugarcoat themselves under their social circle of acquaintances while they feel safer to share true emotions in a relatively anonymous communication environment.

In a group sharing relationship, the app would inform users about times of their posts that have been viewed and "hugs" they received.

                    As for the feedback they would like to receive, 75% users preferred to receive doodle because of the personality behind the drawing:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                           Doodle is unique - it offers than one-word replies as "Sorry" or "Cong". 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Doodle is emphatic, and sometimes drawing communicates better than words. Users also feel more sense of "being heard" because of the effort others took in drawing. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, users preferred the paired sharing ideas because:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                           Exposure to many posts in a group may reduce empathy and lower the amount and quality of reply in turns.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Paired relationship creates a close relationship and makes participants feel more responsible and willing to reply.

                <h3>Data visualization about emotion changes</h3>
                <p>
                Our first vision is to motivate users by visualizing their achievements in collecting and reflection. For example, we have two initial ideas,  one was creating a "virtual garden" and visualizing mood records as flowers. Another one was using a "tree" as the metaphor of time and represented mood records as leaves. Moreover, the tree would grow higher with the records increasing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                 We conducted a very quick usability test to choose the ideas. Surprisingly,  the feedback from users indicated that neither of the two ideas worked. Users are willing to continually use the product because it can bring new value, therefore, intrinsic incentives are much better than extrinsic ones. This finding directed us to make more effort in creating insightful reflection experience. We decided to provide a data visualization about emotion changes, which was an explicitly benefit for users to become more aware of mood patterns and improve self-regulation

                    Users can chat with Elsa if communicating with a close friend to track their moods. Moodie enables users to identify subtle mood more easily by decomposing mood into two levels, and attribute emotion triggers accurately by recalling activity and detailed reasons.

                    As the medium of reply, doodle offers more interesting, empathetic and delightful experience than words. No trolling, no cliche, doodles are surprising gifts for every user. We understand that not everyone is born as artist. Users can create doodles easily by selecting their favorite shapes and fill in color.

                    Moodie not only informs users of their moods during a period, but also reveals influencing factors based on data collected.
